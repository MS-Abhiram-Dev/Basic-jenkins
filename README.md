# README for Code Pipeline

This document outlines the steps and structure of a Jenkins pipeline designed for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline automates the processes of checking out code, building the application, running tests, and deploying to a server.

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline consists of four main stages:

1. **Checkout**: Retrieves the latest code from the specified version control system.
2. **Build**: Compiles the application and creates a deployable package.
3. **Test**: Executes automated tests to ensure the application is functioning correctly.
4. **Deploy**: Transfers the built application to the target server.

### Pipeline Configuration

The pipeline is defined in a Jenkinsfile using a declarative syntax. Below are details for each stage.

#### 1. Checkout

- **Action**: Checks out the code from a Git repository.
- **Command**:
    ```groovy
    git 'https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git'
    ```

#### 2. Build

- **Action**: Runs the build command, typically used for Java projects with Maven.
- **Command**:
    ```groovy
    sh 'mvn clean package'
    ```

#### 3. Test

- **Action**: Executes unit tests to validate the application.
- **Command**:
    ```groovy
    sh 'mvn test'
    ```

#### 4. Deploy

- **Action**: Deploys the built application to a specified server using SCP.
- **Command**:
    ```groovy
    sh 'scp target/your-app.jar user@your-server:/path/to/deploy/'
    ```

### Post Conditions

The pipeline includes post-build actions to handle success and failure outcomes:

- **On Success**:
    ```groovy
    echo 'Pipeline succeeded!'
    ```
- **On Failure**:
    ```groovy
    echo 'Pipeline failed.'
    ```

### Requirements

- Jenkins installed with the necessary plugins for Git and pipeline execution.
- Access to the specified Git repository.
- Maven installed on the Jenkins agent to execute build and test commands.
- SSH access to the target deployment server.

### Usage

1. Place the Jenkinsfile in the root directory of your project repository.
2. Configure a Jenkins job to use this pipeline.
3. Trigger the pipeline manually or set up a webhook for automated execution on code changes.

### Customization

Feel free to modify any commands in the stages according to your project's specific requirements (e.g., changing the build tool or deployment method).
